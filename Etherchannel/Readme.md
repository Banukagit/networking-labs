# Day 05 - EtherChannel (LACP)

## Objective
The objective of this lab was to configure EtherChannel using LACP between two switches to improve redundancy and network reliability.

# EtherChannel Configuration

## Switch1

```bash
interface range fa0/1 - 2
switchport mode trunk
channel-group 1 mode active

interface port-channel 1
switchport mode trunk
```

## Switch2

```bash
interface range fa0/1 - 2
switchport mode trunk
channel-group 1 mode active

interface port-channel 1
switchport mode trunk
```

```bash
show etherchannel summary
```

# Connectivity Testing

Successful ping between PCs:

# Failover Testing

One EtherChannel link was disconnected to test redundancy.

The network remained operational using the remaining active link.

# Troubleshooting

## Issue
EtherChannel link failure (red status lights) after re-inserting a physical cable. Even though the configuration was correct, the switch "suspended" the port when the cable was reconnected, preventing it from joining the logical bundle.

## Cause
Protocol Desynchronization.
When the cable was plugged back in, the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) detected a potential loop before the Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) could complete its "handshake." To protect the network, the switch put the port into an error state to prevent a broadcast storm.

## Fix
Force a Protocol Reset.
Applied a shutdown followed by a no shutdown on the physical interface range. This forced both switches to restart the negotiation process simultaneously, allowing the port to successfully join the Port-Channel bundle
