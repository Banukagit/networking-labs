# Interdepartment Access Control Lab

## 📌 Objective
To implement Access Control Lists (ACLs) to enforce communication restrictions between departments in a small office network.

## 🧱 Topology
- 1 Router
- 2 Switches
- 4 Client PCs
- 1 Internal Server

## 🌐 Network Design

| Department | Network |
|---|---|
| Sales Department | 192.168.10.0/24 |
| IT Department | 192.168.20.0/24 |
| Server Network | 192.168.30.0/24 |

## ⚙️ Configuration Summary

### Router
- Configured routing between multiple networks
- Applied Extended ACL rules to filter traffic

### Security Policy
- Sales department denied access to internal server
- IT department allowed access to internal server

## 📚 Key Learnings

- Learned the difference between Standard ACLs and Extended ACLs  
- Understood how Extended ACLs filter traffic using both source and destination networks  
- Explored how ACL rules are processed sequentially from top to bottom  
- Learned about the implicit deny rule and why `permit ip any any` is important  
- Understood why Extended ACLs are placed close to the source network  
- Gained better understanding of inbound ACL processing and traffic filtering  
- Implemented department-level access restrictions to simulate real organizational security policies

## ✅ Result

Successfully implemented interdepartment access control using Extended ACLs.
